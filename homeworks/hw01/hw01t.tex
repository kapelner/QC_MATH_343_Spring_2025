\begin{abstract}
The path to success in this class is to do many problems. Unlike other courses, exclusively doing reading(s) will not help. Coming to lecture is akin to watching workout videos; thinking about and solving problems on your own is the actual ``working out.''  Feel free to \qu{work out} with others; \textbf{I want you to work on this in groups.}

Reading is still \textit{required}. For this homework set, read as much as you can online about the topics we covered.

The problems below are color coded: \ingreen{green} problems are considered \textit{easy} and marked \qu{[easy]}; \inorange{yellow} problems are considered \textit{intermediate} and marked \qu{[harder]}, \inred{red} problems are considered \textit{difficult} and marked \qu{[difficult]} and \inpurple{purple} problems are extra credit. The \textit{easy} problems are intended to be ``giveaways'' if you went to class. Do as much as you can of the others; I expect you to at least attempt the \textit{difficult} problems. 

This homework is worth 100 points but the point distribution will not be determined until after the due date. See syllabus for the policy on late homework.

Up to 7 points are given as a bonus if the homework is typed using \LaTeX. Links to instaling \LaTeX~and program for compiling \LaTeX~is found on the syllabus. You are encouraged to use \url{overleaf.com}. If you are handing in homework this way, read the comments in the code; there are two lines to comment out and you should replace my name with yours and write your section. The easiest way to use overleaf is to copy the raw text from hwxx.tex and preamble.tex into two new overleaf tex files with the same name. If you are asked to make drawings, you can take a picture of your handwritten drawing and insert them as figures or leave space using the \qu{$\backslash$vspace} command and draw them in after printing or attach them stapled.

The document is available with spaces for you to write your answers. If not using \LaTeX, print this document and write in your answers. I do not accept homeworks which are \textit{not} on this printout. Keep this first page printed for your records.

\easysubproblem{Let $\dime{\thetavec} = p$ and assume a prior $f(\thetavec)$ to be continuous. Describe the steps of the systematic sweep Gibbs Sampler algorithm below that will converge to $f(\thetavec\,|\,\X)$. Label the steps that are necessary for the $p$ dimensions separately e.g. Step 2.1, Step 2.2, \ldots, Step 2.p. You need to reference these step numbers later on in the problem.}\spc{10}

\easysubproblem{Pretend you are estimating $\cprob{\theta_1,~\theta_2}{X}$ and the joint posterior looks like the picture below where the $x$ axis is $\theta_1$ and the $y$ axis is $\theta_2$ and darker colors indicate higher probability. Begin at $\bracks{\theta_1,\theta_2} = \bracks{0.5,0.5}$ and simulate 5 iterations of the systematic sweep Gibbs sampling algorithm by drawing new points on the plot.}
